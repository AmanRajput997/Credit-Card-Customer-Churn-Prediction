# Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-Prediction
## üìù Description
This project aims to predict whether a credit card customer will churn (i.e., close their account). By identifying customers who are likely to churn, the bank can take proactive steps to retain them. This is a binary classification problem, and a neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras to make the predictions.

## üíæ Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Churn Modelling" dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about bank customers who have held a credit card.

You can find the dataset here: [Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction Dataset](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customer-churn-prediction)

### Columns
The dataset has 10,000 rows and the following 14 columns:

‚Ä¢ __RowNumber:__ Row number

‚Ä¢ **CustomerId:** Unique identifier for each customer

‚Ä¢ __Surname:__ Customer's surname

‚Ä¢__CreditScore:__ Customer's credit score

‚Ä¢ __Geography:__ Customer's country (France, Spain, Germany)

‚Ä¢ __Gender:__ Customer's gender

‚Ä¢ __Age:__ Customer's age

‚Ä¢ __Tenure:__ Number of years the customer has been with the bank

‚Ä¢ __Balance:__ Customer's account balance

‚Ä¢ __NumOfProducts:__ Number of bank products the customer uses

‚Ä¢ HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no)

‚Ä¢ IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no)

‚Ä¢ EstimatedSalary: Customer's estimated salary

‚Ä¢ Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no) - This is the target variable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
The project follows these steps:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: The data is loaded using pandas, and initial exploration is done to understand the data's structure and features.

2. Data Preprocessing:

‚Ä¢ Unnecessary columns (RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname) are dropped.

‚Ä¢ Categorical features (Geography, Gender) are converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

3. Train-Test Split: The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

4. Feature Scaling: The numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's training.

5. Model Building: A sequential neural network is built using TensorFlow/Keras with the following architecture:

‚Ä¢ An input layer with 11 neurons and a ReLU activation function.

‚Ä¢ A hidden layer with 11 neurons and a ReLU activation function.

‚Ä¢ An output layer with 1 neuron and a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

6. Model Compilation and Training: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. It is then trained for 100 epochs.

## üìà Results
The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy. The final accuracy on the test set is approximately 85%.
