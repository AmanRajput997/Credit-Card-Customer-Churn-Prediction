# Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-Prediction
📝 Description This project aims to predict whether a credit card customer will churn (i.e., close their account). By identifying customers who are likely to churn, the bank can take proactive steps to retain them. This is a binary classification problem, and a neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras to make the predictions.
